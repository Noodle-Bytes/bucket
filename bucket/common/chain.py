This file contains utilities to label the bounds of items in a tree structure.

Each node is given start and end bounds such that a child's start bound is
always >= a parents start bound, a child's end bound is always <= to a
parents end bound, and a node's end bound is always > its start bound.

This is done by (starting at the root node):
  1. Get this node start bound from one of:
    - (For root node) an initial value, usually 0.
    - (for the first child of a parent) the start bound of the parent .
    -  (for subsequent children) the end bound of the the previous child.
  2. Recurse 1.
  3. Add the size of this node (usually 1) to create the end bound of this
     node.

We describe this process as chaining through the tree, with each Link being
connected to a node in the tree, and containing the start and end bound
information. Links are opened from parents or siblings and passed through
to the next node.

When a link is closed, it adds itself to an shared index, which each link in
a chain has a reference to. The index can be used to iterate over links of
a certain type in a chain.

The start and end bounds can be complex multi-faceted values so long as they
can be added together.
