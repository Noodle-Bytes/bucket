# Bucket


Bucket is a python library to create nicer functional coverpoints. There are several benefits writing the coverage in python, such as:

* Easier integration into cocotb and other python testbenches
* No commercial EDA license required
* Vendor independence - easily collect coverage from multiple tools/sources (eg. models, log parsers, etc)

## Documentation:
[Read the Documentation](docs/index.md)

## Support
This library is being actively built, and is expected to change while it matures and key features are added.
We are not providing external support for use of this library, however we are aiming to make it as easy to use as possible.
