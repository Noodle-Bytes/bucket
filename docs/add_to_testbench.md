## Adding coverage to the testbench

A sampler must be initialised with a reference to the top of the coverage hierarchy (the top level covergroup). The `sample()` method can then be passed a copy of the trace object each time, and will then recursively call each coverpoints sample method.

``` Python
    #Â My testbench

    cvg = MyBigCoverGroup(name="my_toplevel_covergroup", description="All of my coverage")

    sampler = MySampler(coverage=cvg)

    ...
    # Collect trace_data from monitors and other sources, then pass to coverage
    sampler.sample(trace_data)
```
