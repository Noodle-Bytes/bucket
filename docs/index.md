# Getting Started:

To run the example, which includes a coverage tree along with some randomised data to sample, please run:

```
$ ./bin/shell
$ python -m example.example
```

Below describes how to use Bucket to create a coverage tree, sample your data and then merge the results. Examples of coverpoints in use can be seen in [cats.py](https://github.com/VyperCore/bucket/blob/main/example/cats.py) and [dogs.py](https://github.com/VyperCore/bucket/blob/main/example/dogs.py).
